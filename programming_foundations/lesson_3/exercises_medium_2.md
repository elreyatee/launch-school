Question 1

Hashes are commonly found to be more complex than the simple one we saw earlier:

ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 402, "Eddie" => 10 }

It is often the case that each key points to another hash instead of a single value:

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" }
}

Figure out the total age of just the male members of the family.

  Answer:
  total = 0
  munsters.each do |name, data|
    total += data["age"] if data["gender"] == "male"
  end

Question 2

One of the most frequently used real-world string properties is that of "string substitution", where we take a hard-coded string and modify it with various parameters from our program.

Given this previously seen family hash, print out the name, age and gender of each family member:

  munsters = {
    "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
    "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
    "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
    "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
    "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
  }

...like this:

  (Name) is a (age) year old (male or female).

  Answer:
  munsters.each do |name, details|
    puts "#{name} is a #{details["age"]} year old #{details["gender"]}"
  end

Question 3

In an earlier exercise we saw that depending on variables to be modified by called methods can be tricky:

  def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
    a_string_param += "rutabaga"
    an_array_param << "rutabaga"
  end

  my_string = "pumpkins"
  my_array = ["pumpkins"]
  tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

  puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
  puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

We learned that whether the above "coincidentally" does what we think we wanted "depends" upon what is going on inside the method.

How can we refactor this exercise to make the result easier to predict and easier for the next programmer to maintain?

  Answer:
  def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
    a_string_param += "rutabaga"
    an_array_param += ["rutabaga"]

    return a_string_param, an_array_param
  end

  my_string = "pumpkins"
  my_array = ["pumpkins"]
  my_string, my_array = tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

  puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
  puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

Question 4

A quick glance at the docs for the Ruby String class will have you scratching your head over the absence of any "word iterator" methods.

Our natural inclination is to think of the words in a sentence as a collection. We would like to be able to operate on those words the same way we operate on the elements of an array. Where are the String#each_word and the String#map_words methods?

A common idiom used to solve this conundrum is to use the String#split in conjunction with Array#join methods to break our string up and then put it back together again.

Use this technique to break up the following string and put it back together with the words in reverse order:

sentence = "Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall."

  Answer: 
  words = sentence.split(/\W/).reverse!
  new_sentence = words.join(' ') + '.'

Question 5

What is the output of the following code?

answer = 42

def mess_with_it(some_number)
  some_number += 8
end

new_answer = mess_with_it(answer)

p answer - 8

  Answer: 34

Question 6

One day Spot was playing with the Munster family's home computer and he wrote a small program to mess with their demographic data:

  munsters = {
    "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
    "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
    "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
    "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
    "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
  }

  def mess_with_demographics(demo_hash)
    demo_hash.values.each do |family_member|
      family_member["age"] += 42
      family_member["gender"] = "other"
    end
  end

After writing this method, he typed the following...and before Grandpa could stop him, he hit the Enter key with his tail:

  mess_with_demographics(munsters)

Did the family's data get ransacked, or did the mischief only mangle a local copy of the original hash? (why?)

  Answer:
  The data was ransacked ... this relates to call-by-value and call-by-reference. When you pass a parameter into a method, under the hood Ruby does not pass its value but the actual object id of each item.  The method stores the object ids in locally scoped (private to the method) variables - which are named in the method's parameter list.

  The data would have been safe if a copy of the hash was made inside the method. Instead, it actually peers into the hash and changes it.

Question 7

Method calls can take expressions as arguments. Suppose we define a function called rps as follows, which follows the classic rules of rock-paper-scissors game, but with a slight twist that it declares whatever hand was used in the tie as the result of that tie.

def rps(fist1, fist2)
  if fist1 == "rock"
    (fist2 == "paper") ? "paper" : "rock"
  elsif fist1 == "paper"
    (fist2 == "scissors") ? "scissors" : "paper"
  else
    (fist2 == "rock") ? "rock" : "scissors"
  end
end

What is the result of the following call?

puts rps(rps(rps("rock", "paper"), rps("rock", "scissors")), "rock")

  Answer: 
  puts rps(rps(rps("rock", "paper"), rps("rock", "scissors")), "rock")
  puts rps(rps(rps("rock", "paper"), "rock"), "rock")
  puts rps(rps("paper", "rock"), "rock")
  puts rps("paper", "rock")
  => "paper"

Question 8

Consider these two simple methods:

  def foo(param = "no")
    "yes"
  end

  def bar(param = "no")
    param == "no" ? "yes" : "no"
  end

What would be the output of this code:

  bar(foo)

  Answer: "no"
